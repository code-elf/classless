# Classless

`classless` is a mini-framework with the goal of making web UI development a little simpler.

CSS is full of obscure properties with more being added every year, many of which might be useful in certain cases, but it would be unreasonable to expect especially someone new to frontend development to know them all.

There are many existing frameworks attempting to bridge this gap by either offering a collection of premade components or taking CSS out of the equation entirely by using utility classes, but this one takes a different approach.

CSS shouldn't be daunting, painful, or annoying. Making a simple, consistent frontend shouldn't require work.

This little framework attempts to make just that easier - so CSS isn't the obstacle to writing something simple anymore.
